# GA_Card_Problem

The card problem is where there are ten cards labeled 1-10, all the cards must be sorted into two different; Pile 0 and Pile 1. All of the cards in pile 0 are multilpied togeather, and must give a score of 360, whistle all of the cards in pile 1 are added togeather, and must get a score of 36.

Using Genetic Algorithm (GA) may not be must efficent way to solve this problm. However I decided to use a GA to improve my knowlwedge of GA and to apply the knowledge I learnt in my Artifical Intelligence module.
