# GA_Card_Problem

The card problem is where there are ten cards labelled 1-10, all the cards must be sorted into two different; Pile 0 and Pile 1. All of the cards in pile 0 are multiplied together. Whistle all of the cards in pile 1 are added together. To solution to this problem must have pile 0 to be a number of 360 and pile 0 to be the number of 36.

Using Genetic Algorithm (GA) may not be must efficient way to solve this problem. However, I decided to use a GA to improve my knowledge of GA and to apply the knowledge I learnt in my Artifical Intelligence module.
